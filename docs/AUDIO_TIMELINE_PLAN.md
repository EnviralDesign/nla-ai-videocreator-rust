# Audio Timeline Implementation Plan (Rust)

## Goals (MVP)
- Import audio assets and place them on audio tracks (already in data model).
- Waveform visualization on audio clips.
- Low-latency playback and scrubbing tied to the timeline playhead.
- Audio duration probes, caching, and reuse across sessions.

## Current Codebase Surface Area
- Audio assets/tracks/clips already exist in state (`src/state/asset.rs`, `src/state/project/*`).
- Duration probing uses `ffprobe` for audio/video (`src/core/media.rs`).
- Timeline clip rendering is visual-only; no waveform layer (`src/timeline/clip_element.rs`).
- Thumbnail cache is image/video only (`src/core/thumbnailer.rs`).
- Preview renderer ignores audio (`src/core/preview/renderer.rs`).

## Proposed Architecture (Codebase-Aware)

### Core Modules
- Add `src/core/audio/` with submodules:
  - `decode.rs`: decode audio to PCM (f32) from file.
  - `resample.rs`: resample to engine output format.
  - `playback.rs`: audio output stream + mixer.
  - `waveform.rs`: peak extraction + cache IO.
  - `cache.rs`: cache metadata and invalidation.
- Keep UI-specific logic in `src/components/` and `src/timeline/`.

### Audio Engine Output Format
- Standardize on `48kHz`, stereo, interleaved `f32`.
- Rationale: video-centric default and stable device compatibility.

### Decode + Resample
- Use `ffmpeg-next` for decode and resample (already in repo).
- Seek by timestamp; flush decoder; decode and drop samples until exact position.
- For non-FFmpeg fallback, consider `symphonia` later (not MVP).

### Playback + Sync
- Use `cpal` for low-latency output and full control.
- Audio callback mixes active clips based on a shared atomic sample counter.
- UI playhead reads the audio clock (sample counter / sample rate).
- Scrubbing:
  - On drag, reset the engine to the new timeline time.
  - Decode a short buffer (100-250ms) for immediate feedback.

### Waveform Generation + Cache
- Compute peak envelope (min/max) per block.
- Store multi-resolution "mip" levels for zooming.
- Cache format (project-local): `.cache/audio/peaks/<asset_id>.peaks`
  - Header includes: version, file size, mtime, sample rate, channels, block sizes.
  - Invalidate on size/mtime/version mismatch.
- Build peaks in the background (non-blocking on import/open).
  - Prioritize a coarse level first, then fill finer levels.

### Waveform Resolution Selection (Variable Zoom)
- Zoom is continuous (pixels-per-second), so select the nearest mip level at draw time.
- Compute `samples_per_pixel` from zoom and sample rate.
- Choose the smallest block size that is >= `samples_per_pixel`.
- This keeps redraw fast and avoids re-decoding on zoom changes.

### Cache Refresh (User Action)
- Right-click “Refresh” should rebuild media caches per asset:
  - Visual assets: thumbnails.
  - Audio assets: waveform peaks.

### Timeline Rendering
- For audio clips, render a waveform overlay in `ClipElement`.
- Use a per-clip canvas layer and draw from peak data for the visible range.
- On zoom change, redraw from the appropriate mip level (no re-decode).

### Export (Future)
- Offline mix using the same engine (no real-time constraints).
- Optionally use ffmpeg to encode/mux after mixdown.

## Phased Delivery
1. Audio engine v1: decode + playback + audio clock.
2. Waveform v1: peak cache + canvas drawing.
3. Scrubbing polish: short-buffer preview while dragging.
4. Export mixdown path (offline render).
5. Optional: beat detection markers.

## Implementation Order (Atomic Steps + Inspection Breaks)
1. Add audio core scaffolding (`src/core/audio/*`) and wire module exports.
2. Implement ffmpeg decode + resample to f32 stereo (no UI yet).
3. Add cpal output + mixer + audio clock.
4. Inspection Break: verify play/pause/seek audio output and playhead sync.
5. Implement peak cache format + background builder (project-local).
6. Inspection Break: verify cache files are created and rebuild on refresh.
7. Render waveforms in timeline (canvas overlay per audio clip).
8. Inspection Break: verify waveform visibility across zoom levels.
9. Implement scrubbing audio buffer during drag (short buffer).
10. Inspection Break: verify scrubbing audio responsiveness.
11. Run `cargo check` after each step that changes Rust code.

## Decisions (Confirmed)
- Decode/resample: `ffmpeg-next` (extend existing dependency).
- Playback: `cpal` (low-latency callback control).
- Waveform cache: project-local peak files with multi-res blocks.

## Open Questions / Risks
- AAC licensing risk if we decode via FFmpeg (same as current video decode).
- Performance on very long audio files: peak build should stay backgrounded with a coarse-first strategy.
