# NLA AI Video Creator

> **A local-first, AI-native Non-Linear Animation editor for generative video production.**

---

## 🎯 Vision

**NLA AI Video Creator** is a desktop application designed to bridge the gap between creative intent and AI-powered video generation. It provides filmmakers, animators, and content creators with an intuitive timeline-based environment to orchestrate AI-generated content—keyframe images, video segments, and audio—into cohesive short films.

The tool embraces a **"bring your own AI"** philosophy. Rather than locking users into a single provider or workflow, it offers a modular adapter architecture that lets creators plug in their preferred tools—whether that's commercial APIs like Veo3 and fal.ai, or custom ComfyUI workflows they've painstakingly crafted.

### The Problem

Creating AI-generated short films today is *tedious*:
- Switching between generation tools and video editors
- Manually downloading, renaming, and importing assets
- Losing creative flow while waiting for generations
- No unified timeline view of audio + keyframes + generated segments
- Difficulty coordinating keyframe images with beat markers in music

### The Solution

A purpose-built NLA editor that:
1. **Unifies the workflow** — Audio, keyframes, and video segments live in one timeline
2. **Integrates AI natively** — Generate images and videos directly from the editor
3. **Stays flexible** — Swap providers per-project or per-shot via adapters
4. **Works locally** — Your projects, your machine, your data (with optional cloud features later)

## 📐 Core Concepts

### 1. Project

A **Project** is the top-level container. It has:
- A name and save location (folder = project, KISS)
- Global settings (resolution, frame rate, export preferences)
- One or more **Tracks**
- Provider configuration (global for MVP)

### 2. App Settings

Global application settings (not per-project):
- **Projects folder location** — Where new projects are created by default
- UI preferences (theme, layout)
- Default providers / presets
- FFmpeg path override (if not on PATH)

### 3. Tracks

The timeline consists of layered tracks:

| Track Type | Purpose | Duplicatable |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Video Track** | Holds video clips, image clips (stills with duration), and generative visual content | Yes |
| **Audio Track** | Holds audio clips and generative audio content | Yes |
| **Marker Track** | Holds point-in-time markers (beat markers, scene breaks, notes) | No |

> **Note:** Images are placed on Video tracks as stills with duration, following standard NLE conventions. There is no separate "Keyframe" track—reference images for generation are simply clips that overlap generative clips in time.
> 
> See [CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](./CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full content and generation architecture.

### 4. Markers / Keypoints

Markers are timestamp annotations that can:
- Be placed manually (MVP)
- Be auto-generated from audio analysis (beat detection, transients)
- Carry metadata (labels, colors, types)
- Trigger or guide generation tasks

### 5. Generation Tasks

A **Generation Task** is a request to an AI provider:
- **Image Generation** — Create a keyframe image from a prompt
- **Image-to-Video (I2V)** — Animate a keyframe into a video segment
- **Video-to-Video (V2V)** — Transform/stylize an existing video
- **Video Extension** — Extend a video segment forward or backward
- **Audio Generation** — *(Future)* Generate audio from video, or music from prompts
- **Audio Analysis** — *(Future)* Extract beats, segments, transcription

> Note: Audio isn't just an anchor—it might itself be generated content.

### 6. Provider Entries

Provider entries are the pluggable backends that execute generation tasks. Key principles:
- **Single-purpose** — Each entry does ONE thing (image gen, I2V, etc.). If a service supports multiple capabilities, the user adds separate entries for each.
- Configured via simple JSON/config
- Can be a commercial API, local ComfyUI instance, or custom HTTP endpoint
- ComfyUI entries reference an API workflow JSON via `workflow_path` (relative to repo/app or absolute path; MVP default: `workflows/sdxl_simple_example_API.json`)
- Details of the adapter interface will be discovered during implementation—we're keeping this intentionally vague until we experiment with real ComfyUI workflows.

---

> **Intentionally vague for now.** We'll discover the right abstractions when we actually integrate with ComfyUI and experiment with real workflows. Premature abstraction is the enemy of good design.

---

## 🎥 Rendering & Preview Strategy

### 1. Robust Compositor (Canvas-based)
We are skipping intermediate "DOM overlay" solutions to build a production-grade compositing engine from the start. This ensures support for pixel-perfect operations, affine transformations (scale, rotate, translate), and complex blending.

#### Architecture
1.  **Frame Server (Rust)**
    - Managed by a background thread (Tokio).
    - Responsible for fetching or decoding frame data for the current timestamp.
    - **Caching Strategy**: To ensure smooth scrubbing, we will employ a hybrid strategy:
        - **Images**: Loaded fast from disk/memory.
        - **Video**: decoded on demand or pre-cached as low-res proxy image sequences for performance.
2.  **Compositor (Rust)**
    - Takes raw frame buffers from the Frame Server.
    - Applies a "Render Graph" of operations:
        - **Transform**: Scale, Rotate, Translate (Project Canvas coordinates).
        - **Composite**: Layering using standard blending modes (Source Over).
    - Outputs a single raw RGBA buffer for the viewport.
3.  **Display (Frontend/Dioxus)**
    - A single `<canvas>` element in the Preview Panel.
    - Rust sends the composited RGBA buffer to the shared UI memory or via efficient binary transfer.
    - JavaScript draws the buffer using `putImageData` or WebGL texture upload.

### 2. Thumbnail Generation
Visual feedback on the timeline.
- **Mechanism**: Background FFmpeg task.
- **Output**: Cached JPEGs stored in `.project/cache/thumbnails/`.
- **UI**: CSS `background-image` sprite sheets for performance.

## 🔌 Provider System

### Design Goals

1. **Simplicity** — Adding a provider should be straightforward, not overwhelming
2. **Single-purpose entries** — Each provider entry does ONE thing. Want image gen AND I2V from the same service? Add two entries.
3. **Configurability** — JSON-based configuration (API URL, auth key, workflow path, etc.)
4. **Flexibility** — A project can mix providers freely (Provider A for images, Provider B for I2V)

### Entry Types

The types of things a provider entry can do:
- **Image Generation** — Text/prompt → Image
- **Image-to-Video (I2V)** — Image → Video segment
- **Video-to-Video (V2V)** — Video → Transformed video
- **Video Extension** — Video → Longer video
- *(Future: Audio analysis, beat detection, etc.)*

### Implementation Notes

> **Intentionally vague for now.** We'll discover the right abstractions when we actually integrate with ComfyUI and experiment with real workflows. Premature abstraction is the enemy of good design.

### Example Providers (Ideas)

| Provider | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| ComfyUI workflow #1 | Image Gen | User's custom SDXL style workflow |
| ComfyUI workflow #2 | I2V | User's AnimateDiff or similar |
| fal.ai Kling | I2V | Commercial API |
| Veo3 | I2V | Commercial API |
| Replicate Model X | Image Gen | Commercial API |

Users can add as many entries as they need. The same underlying service (like ComfyUI) might have multiple entries for different workflows/purposes.

### Dynamic Provider UI (Sockets)

Providers have **bespoke input requirements**. Some need just text, others need text + image, etc. The UI should have a framework that:
- Allows providers to declare their input schema
- Dynamically renders appropriate input fields (text boxes, image pickers, sliders, etc.)
- Acts as "sockets" that can be plugged into from the predefined tools

> **Intentionally vague on implementation.** The goal is to avoid hardcoding provider UIs—instead, a harness that adapts based on what each provider needs.

---

## 🎬 User Workflow (MVP)

### Phase 1: Setup
### Phase 1: Setup
1. User opens the app → **Startup Modal** appears (New Project / Open Project)
2. **New Project**: User selects a folder/name. System immediately creates the folder structure on disk.
3. **Open Project**: User selects an existing `project.json` or folder.
4. App loads with the project active.
2. Sets project dimensions (1080p, 4K, etc.) and frame rate
3. Configures one or more providers in the Provider panel

### Phase 2: Audio & Planning
1. Imports an audio file (MP3/WAV) → appears on Audio Track
2. Plays through audio, manually places markers at key moments
3. Optionally labels markers ("intro", "beat drop", "climax")

### Phase 3: Keyframes
1. At each marker (or selected markers), user creates a keyframe slot
2. Either:
   - **Imports** an existing image
   - **Generates** via a configured image provider (types prompt, clicks "Generate")
3. Keyframe appears in the Keyframe Track at that timestamp

### Phase 4: Video Generation
1. User selects two adjacent keyframes
2. Chooses an I2V provider and parameters
3. Clicks "Generate Video Segment"
4. Generated video appears in the Video Track, spanning between keyframes

### Phase 5: Export
1. User arranges tracks as desired
2. Clicks "Export" → FFmpeg composites audio + video → final output
3. *(Future)* Option to "Export Parts" — individual clips with nice filenames for external editing

---

## 🎨 UI Principles

### Fluidity & Polish

The UI should feel **alive and responsive**:
- **Hover effects** on all interactive elements (buttons, clips, markers)
- **Smooth transitions** on state changes (selections, panel toggles)
- **Timeline smoothness** — scrubbing, zooming, and panning should feel buttery
- No jarring state jumps; prefer animated transitions where practical

### Attribute Editor

A context-sensitive panel that displays properties of the current selection:
- If **one item** is selected → show all editable properties
- If **multiple items of the same type** are selected → show common properties, edits apply to all
- If **mixed types** are selected → show only universally applicable actions (delete, etc.)

This panel adapts based on what's selected in the **timeline** or **asset browser**.

### Labels vs. Filenames

Every asset (clip, keyframe, audio file) has:
- **Filename** — The actual file on disk (auto-generated or imported)
- **Label** — A user-facing display name (optional, can be different from filename)

This supports:
- Friendly display in the UI ("Intro Scene" instead of `seg_001_002.mp4`)
- Future "Export Parts" feature where clips get nice descriptive names

### State Architecture

Inspired by **Blender's multi-view model**:
- **Shared core data** — The project, assets, timeline clips exist once in memory
- **View-specific state** — Each panel (asset browser, timeline, attribute editor) may have its own selection, scroll position, etc.
- **Selection is centralized** — A single selection state that multiple views can observe and modify
- **Modular and flat** — Avoid deep nesting; prefer distinct state slices that can be composed

This allows:
- Asset browser showing the same asset that's on the timeline
- Attribute editor responding to selections from either view
- Multiple views staying in sync without tight coupling

## 📋 Decision Log

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Use Dioxus Desktop (not Web/Tauri) | Full local experience, single DX language (RSX), simpler architecture | ✅ Decided |
| FFmpeg on PATH for MVP | Simplifies initial development; bundling is later optimization | ✅ Decided |
| JSON for provider configs | Machine-readable, toolable, familiar | ✅ Decided |
| Project-local asset folders | Portable, self-contained projects | ✅ Decided |
| Folder = Project (KISS) | Simple mental model, easy to backup/share | ✅ Decided |
| Async job queue for generations | Non-blocking UI while waiting for slow API calls | ✅ Decided |
| Single-purpose provider entries | Simpler mental model; add service twice if it does multiple things | ✅ Decided |
| MIT License | Maximum adoption, permissive, standard for tools | ✅ Decided |
| Secrets via .env | Simple, familiar, users manage their own keys | ✅ Decided |
| Lean development philosophy | Build custom, avoid dependency bloat, iterate with user | ✅ Decided |
| Modular state (Blender-inspired) | Multiple views can share/observe same data with their own view state | ✅ Decided |
| Labels separate from filenames | Enables friendly display names + future "Export Parts" feature | ✅ Decided |
| Audio scrubbing is essential | Without hearing audio while scrubbing, the tool is unusable for music-synced work | ✅ Decided |
| UI fluidity is non-negotiable | Hover effects, smooth transitions, polished feel from day one | ✅ Decided |
| Dioxus 0.7 (latest) | Hot-patching support, better signals, performance improvements | ✅ Decided |
| Transitions disabled during drag | Instant resize feedback; transitions only for collapse/expand | ✅ Decided |
| Stable uncontrolled inputs for text/number/textarea | Prevent Dioxus Desktop cursor jumps by avoiding value binding | ✅ Decided |
| App-local Timeline State (Temp) | Kept state simple in app.rs until data model requirements mature | ✅ Decided |
| Scroll-synced Track Labels | CSS sticky positioning for rock-solid sync vs JS event listeners | ✅ Decided |
| Draggable Playhead | Real-time updating during drag for immediate feedback | ✅ Decided |
| 1-Second Step Buttons | Frame-stepping felt too slow; 1s steps preferred for navigating | ✅ Decided |
| Frame-snapped Playhead | All seeking snaps to 60fps frame boundaries for accurate positioning | ✅ Decided |
| Click-to-scrub Interaction | Click anywhere on ruler to seek; playhead follows cursor, not grabbed | ✅ Decided |
| Hierarchical Timeline Layout | Fixed left column + scrollable right column; no JS scroll sync needed | ✅ Decided |
| Playhead as Visual Indicator | Triangle handle is purely visual; interaction is on ruler bar | ✅ Decided |
| Generative Assets as Explicit Creation | Users explicitly create generative assets via UI; they start "hollow" and get populated through generation | ✅ Decided |
| Generative Assets Have Versions | Each generation creates a new version; user picks active version; dependent assets use active version | ✅ Decided |
| Timeline as Implicit Wiring | Overlapping assets auto-surface as input suggestions; no explicit linking required | ✅ Decided |
| Audio stack v1 | Use ffmpeg-next for decode/resample, cpal for playback, and project-local peak cache for waveforms | ✅ Decided |
| Providers Grouped by Output Type | Video/Image/Audio; input requirements vary per provider via dynamic schema | ✅ Decided |
| Provider Bindings via Selectors | Bind workflow inputs by selector/tag instead of node IDs | ✅ Decided |
| Provider Builder UI | Workflow picker + node browser for exposed inputs | ✅ Decided |
| Adapter-Agnostic Manifests | Use a versioned manifest per adapter type for provider bindings | ✅ Decided |
| No Separate Keyframe Track | Images are clips on Video tracks; "keyframes" are just overlapping reference images | ✅ Decided |
| In-Project Assets Only (MVP) | All assets must be in project folder; external refs are future enhancement | ✅ Decided |
| Canvas Compositor Strategy | Skip DOM overlay; build robust pixel-buffer compositing for transforms/blending immediately | ✅ Decided |

- **2026-01-07:** Added wgpu upload timing to the preview performance overlay
- **2026-01-07:** WGPU preview now uploads RGBA frames to a texture and renders via a quad (canvas uploads suppressed once native preview is active)
- **2026-01-07:** Restored preview canvas visibility while the native host is active and fixed preview overlay stacking so stats stay visible
- **2026-01-06:** Added preview performance overlay (cache hit rate + per-stage timing) to guide optimization work
- **2026-01-06:** Served preview frames from in-memory PNG store to remove per-frame disk writes
- **2026-01-06:** Switched preview output to raw RGBA canvas uploads (removed PNG encode from the loop)
- **2026-01-06:** Added preview stats reference doc (overlay field definitions)
- **2026-01-06:** Added wgpu native preview surface spike (child window + bounds sync)
- **2026-01-06:** Throttled native preview init/update to avoid UI stalls (bounds change + redraw gating)
- **2026-01-06:** Updated ffmpeg-next to v8.0.0 to align with FFmpeg 7.x headers from vcpkg
- **2026-01-06:** Added in-process FFmpeg decode worker for preview frame extraction
- **2026-01-06:** Removed ffmpeg scale filter from preview decode to avoid empty frames; scaling happens in Rust after decode
- **2026-01-06:** Fixed preview latest-wins gating so in-flight renders don't get discarded when the render gate is busy
- **2026-01-09:** Started Provider UI V2 rebuild to fix persistent state management issues—created clean modals with no draft buffers, no effects for init, direct file I/O
- **2026-01-09:** Fixed Provider Builder not re-initializing on subsequent opens—`initialized` flag was preventing seed processing after first modal open
- **2026-01-06:** Added preview frame cache (2GB budget), latest-wins scheduling, and prefetch window for smoother scrubbing
- **2026-01-06:** Clip context menu now supports moving clips up/down to compatible tracks
- **2026-01-06:** Attribute editor numeric fields commit on blur/Enter to avoid input jitter
- **2026-01-06:** Added preview renderer v0 (ffmpeg frame extraction + compositing) and playhead-driven preview updates
- **2026-01-06:** Added clip transforms + single-clip selection with transform editing in Attributes panel
- **2026-01-06:** Startup modal now captures project resolution, FPS, and duration; location field moved to bottom with separator
- **2026-01-06:** Added project duration to settings and extended timeline ruler ticks across full duration
- **2026-01-06:** Fixed left-edge trim drift by anchoring to drag-start end time
- **2026-01-06:** Removed unused `mut` warnings from thumbnail tick signals and clip resize logic
- **2026-01-06:** Added clip trim-in state for left-edge trimming; timeline thumbnails now offset by trim-in and clip filmstrip is clipped to bounds
- **2026-01-06:** Fixed thumbnail refresh wiring for asset/timeline panels and duration probe helpers
- **2026-01-06:** Asset durations now cached via ffprobe for audio/video; clips use asset duration on drop/add and resizing is clamped to source length
- **2026-01-06:** Thumbnail URLs now cache-bust on refresh and missing files no longer render broken images
- **2026-01-06:** Asset panel shows first-frame thumbnails for visual assets; timeline thumbnails distribute across clips using 1s sampling with repeat-fill on zoom
- **2026-01-06:** Implemented robust custom protocol (`http://nla.localhost`) for serving local thumbnails
- **2026-01-06:** Added "Rendering & Preview Strategy" to docs
- **2026-01-06:** Promoted Preview Window and Thumbnails to MVP status based on user feedback
- **2026-01-06:** Added right-click context menu to delete projects from startup modal
- **2026-01-06:** Fixed project list layout (compact items, proper overflow handling, scrollable)
- **2026-01-06:** Improved Startup Modal: existing projects now listed automatically, file dialogs start from projects folder
- **2026-01-04:** Implemented custom context menus for track management
- **2026-01-04:** Added "Move Up/Down" track reordering via context menu
- **2026-01-04:** Fixed window title and removed default Win/Edit/Help menu bar
- **2026-01-04:** Added viewport-constrained context menu positioning
- **2026-01-04:** Implemented New Project modal dialog with folder creation
- **2026-01-04:** Added track add/remove functionality with UI buttons
- **2026-01-04:** Integrated Project data model with timeline (dynamic tracks)
- **2026-01-04:** Created core data structures (Project, Track, Clip, Asset, Marker)
- **2026-01-04:** Implemented timeline clip interactions (Move, Resize, Delete, Drag & Drop)
- **2026-01-04:** Refined resize handles and fixed context menus

## 🧭 Development Philosophy

> **"Tight, lean, focused."**

This project intentionally:
- **Avoids premature abstraction** — We discover the right patterns during implementation, not before
- **Minimizes external dependencies** — If we can build it simply, we do
- **Iterates with the user** — Frequent check-ins, test early, refine as we go
- **Stays in its lane** — AI video generation workflow, not a full-featured video editor
- **Values feel over features** — Every component should feel intentional and polished
- **Prioritizes fluidity** — Smooth hover effects, transitions, and scrubbing from the start

We start with the UI shell, dial in the look and feel, then layer in functionality. Style and UX decisions are made early to avoid refactoring across the codebase later.
